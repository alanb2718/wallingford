%
% dissertations are lastname-phd
% example:

   abstract = {(A 1985 version also exists.) Starts with a description of 
    tiling versus overlapping windows. Then describes a constraint based 
    system, RTL/CRTL for specifying the layout of tiled windows. The 
    constraints have priorities, and are solved from strongest to weakest 
    by an ad-hoc algorithm.  Constraints can include: which windows must 
    be present on the screen, their size and location, adjacency and 
    alignment requirements, limits on the ways that the system may change 
    the layout (stability), and particular organizations of windows on 
    the screen.  Other interesting features include constraint strength 
    aging, window peeking and silver, and window families (groups of 
    related windows). Good paper.}}
