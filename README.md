# wallingford

Wallingford is an experimental constraint reactive programming
language written in Rosette.  It includes facilities for handling
persistent constraints, hard and soft constraints, and reactive
constraints.

Directories:
* core -- the core system
* applications -- various applications built on core
* reactive -- additional classes for adding reactive constraints to the core
* tests -- these use RackUnit
