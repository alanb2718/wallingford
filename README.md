# wallingford

Wallingford is an experimental DSL for handling state and updates,
along with constraints, in Rosette.  It is intended as a stepping
stone toward a full constraint reactive programming language.

Directories:
* core -- the core system
* applications -- various applications built on core
* tests -- these use RackUnit
* babelsberg -- version that tries to mimic Babelsberg as closely as possible
* docs -- papers and memos
* misc -- holding pen for miscellaneous code (may or may not run; generally you can ignore stuff in this directory)
